I like your game! It’s super addictive. I love that the interface is easy to understand, and that you tell me what it means to press a blue or a red dot. The goals that I get are really high - I basically lose interest around point 25, so maybe the random number should be between 10 and 30 or something like that. 

Awesome job with this app - I hope you’re proud of it, since I am definitely proud of your work with it.
