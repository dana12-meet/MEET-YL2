A) I typed in the terimal:	python manage.py syncdb
				python manage.py runserver
I went to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies

B) the URL in the browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/1/
   URL of the second movie: http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/2/
   100 movies: http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/100/

c) the function that gets callede is: def add_movie
   "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/5/" the function that gets called is: def movie

when you type “http://127.0.0.1:8000/shrek” into the browser it won`t work because there is no reference to it in url.py
